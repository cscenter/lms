How to register and send new notification:
    1. Create new notification type in admin. Add notification code to
    notifications.constants.NOTIFICATION_TYPES

    2. Create module `notifications` in your app. Make sure your app added to
    django.conf.settings.INSTALLED_APPS or it won't be visible to registry.

    3. Decorate notification handler with `register`.
    Notification type should be instance of notification.types
    Handler class should be inherited from NotificationService.
        from notifications import types
        from notifications.decorators import register
        @register(notification_type=types.LOG)
        class NewNotification(NotificationService):
            # Implement all abstract classes
            pass

    4. Generate event for `notify` Signal with provided `notification_type`.
    Receiver of `notify` signal will dispatch your event to appropriate
    notification handler or throw an error.
        from notifications.signals import notify
        from notification import types
        notify.send(
            comment.author,  # actor
            type=types.LOG,  # notification type
            verb='added',
            description="new comment added",
            action_object=comment,  # The object linked to the action itself.
            target=report,  # The object to which the activity was performed.
            recipient=recipient)

        An example to clarify what is target/action/actor/verb:
            justquick (actor) closed (verb) issue 2 (object)
            on activity-stream (target) 12 hours ago

Internals overview:
    `notifications` app uses Django autodiscover feature to find all
    `notifications` modules among registered apps. On module importing,
    all notification handler classes decorated by `register` with
    valid notification type will be registered in global NotificationRegistry.
    After that you can send message to `notify` Signal with specified
    notification type and receiver of `notify` Signal already know, what
    to do with message, how process and queue it in DB.

Limitations:
    actor, action_object and target models should have PK as `int`
